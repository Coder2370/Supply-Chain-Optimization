**Digital Supply Chain Optimization Initiative** | Lead Analyst | GitHub
August 2024 – November 2024

• Implemented ABC-XYZ inventory classification analyzing 12,500+ SKUs 
  using Python (Pandas, NumPy), achieving 22% inventory turnover 
  improvement and $4.2-5.1M annual carrying cost reduction

• Developed machine learning demand forecasting ensemble (XGBoost, 
  Prophet, LSTM) improving forecast accuracy from 22% MAPE to 8.5%, 
  reducing stockouts 67% through Python/Scikit-learn
